bcd is for parellel, one whole word at a time, all the bits of the word at the same time
1 byte = 8 bit
1 word = depends on computer, usually 64
!! when converting, reversal of the number is because of the significance
	bigger numbers are more significant, so we write them first !!
bigger fraction, smaller error
GRAY - something with XOR
BCD - every number is represented individually, only digits!
memory will overflow if number is too large, doesnt fit in enought bits -> wrap around to 0 (very bad)
